# ReactSchoolDatabaseClient

Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Unit 10 Project - A Full-Stack school database client

## Project Description

The final project of the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree program, this project provides a frontend for the School Course REST API that I created earlier (found [here](https://github.com/ZTMowrer947/SchoolDatabaseAPI))

## Features

- Credentials are persisted using HTTP Cookies
- Course Deletion require confirmation before operation can be executed
- User-friendly validation and error handling

## Skills Demonstrated

- React
- React Router
- Cross-origin Resource Sharing
- HTTP Cookies
- Axios
- Requesting and using data from a REST API

## Running the project

To use this project, you must first set up the REST API that this project uses to perform operations.

First, clone this repository.

Next, in the repository root, initialize the api submodule:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, install dependencies for both the rest API and the frontend app:

```
cd api
yarn install
cd ../client
yarn install
```

Finally, start the REST API first, then the frontend:

```
cd ../api
yarn start
(in another terminal, starting in repository root)
cd client
yarn start
```

The frontend app should open in your default browser automatically and display a course listing from the API.
